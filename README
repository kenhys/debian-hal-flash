This is the libhal-flash package.

It is loosely based upon libhal.[ch] from the hal-0.5.14 package for the external interface presented by the shared library libhal.  Further information on HAL can be found here:  http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal

WARNING - this is not a fully functional HAL layer!

The Adobe Flash web browser plugin for Linux relies upon libhal to provide
information required by libadobecp (which libflashplayer.so retrieves from the
internet) for playing back drm content.

Since HAL is no longer centric to most modern Linux systems (now we have UDev,
UDisks etc) - I'm only providing this library until such time as HTML5 becomes
standard for online TV (many sites continue to use Flash).

RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS

Note - This library requires UDisks2 and a running DBus service!
