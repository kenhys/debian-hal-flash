Build Instructions:

This assumes you downloaded and unpacked a release tarball as found here:
https://github.com/cshorler/hal-flash/releases

1. Generic instructions are applicable
   $ ./configure --prefix=...
   $ make
   $ make install DESTDIR=...

2. For system install the dynamic loader cache needs updating
   # ldconfig

3. For user install the search path for the loader can be set in the environment
   i. For example in your ~/.profile
   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/install/lib/dir
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Packaging:
1. Ensure the HAL package (daemon, library etc) is not installed and ideally
   conflicts with this package.
2. The flash package could recommend this package for drm content.

Development (only applies to a git cloned tree):

1. Prerequisites: autoconf, libtool, C compiler, ... (i.e. you need a standard development base system).
   $ autoreconf -i
   $ ./configure --prefix=...  (as above)
   $ make
   $ make install DESTDIR=...
   $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/dev/install /path/to/test_program
